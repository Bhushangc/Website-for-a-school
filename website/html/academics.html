           As per the provision of the Education Act of Nepal, basic education spans from grade 1 (One) to 10 (Ten). To ensure that students receive developmentally appropriate instruction, we have bifurcated the basic education into the Primary Elementary wing (Grade 1 – 5) and Middle Elementary wing (Grade 6 – 10).<br><br>

        The school uses the International Primary Curriculum (IPC) framework to deliver the National Curriculum of Nepal in a thematic and progressive approach. The IPC is an internationally recognized curriculum framework which is flexible and accommodates national curricula of any country.<br><br>

        We have adopted units within the IPC that best meets and enriches our national curriculum goals. The units chosen for study have been linked to the Curriculum Development Centre’s guidelines to ensure that students have access to relevant materials, and attain intended learning outcomes. The curriculum is divided into three Mile Posts (1, 2 and 3) which broadly link to Grade 1 and 2, Grade 3 and 4, and Grade 5 and 6 of the Nepali system. It provides an excellent structure and pedagogical rigor that supports student learning and progress, and connects with real world examples.<br><br>

        Teachers are encouraged to make links to both local and global ideas and concepts whilst acknowledging individual differences. The IPC’s International Learning Goals help children begin the move towards an increasingly sophisticated national, international, global and intercultural perspective to help develop a sense of ‘international mindedness’.<br><br>

        In the lower elementary grades (Grade 1 – 5), teachers are placed in interdisciplinary teams, and are required to regularly work purposefully and collaboratively. In the upper elementary grades and high school, Class Mentors are assigned to a section of any one grade. Besides teaching assigned subject(s) to relevant grade students according to the curriculum, Class Mentors will also have to coordinate with other grade and subject teachers to maintain consistency in the progress of the curriculum and develop lesson plans and instructional ideas according to school’s learning principles.<br>

                    <p>Green Plant is a coeducational day and boarding school for grades I to X. We welcome and enroll
                        students of all faiths, races, and backgrounds, and offer various need-based scholarships each
                        year. <br> We have small class size which enables staff to build strong relationship with the
                        children, know their families well and work teachers and parents together as a team for the
                        benefit of the children in our care. Each child is fully supported at each stage of learning.
